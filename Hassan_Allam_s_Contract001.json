              "text": "The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that they are fully aware of the current and potential economic circumstances prevailing in the Country, including but not limited to inflation, fluctuations in and devaluation of the local currency value, and macroeconomic changes that may impact the financial stability of the Contract.\n\nAccordingly, the Parties have mutually agreed upon the formula and adjustment mechanism as outlined herein, which is expressly designed to account for any increases or decreases in the value of the local currency throughout the duration of the Contract. This adjustment mechanism shall be applied consistently and transparently as per the relevant terms and conditions of Contract, and the Parties acknowledge and agree that by applying these formulae, provided that all conditions precedent for such application are fulfilled, the financial obligations and entitlements of both Parties remain equitable.\n\nThe Parties further confirm that this formula serves as the sole means of currency value adjustment under this Contract, and no additional claims related to currency fluctuations shall be entertained unless otherwise expressly provided for in the Contract.\n\nThis acknowledgment and adjustment mechanism are integral to the Contract and are accepted by both Parties as fair, reasonable, and reflective of the mutual understanding of the economic environment at the time of execution.\n\nThe following addition/omission to the Contract Sum as resulted from the adjustment formulas below shall be applicable and shall not be considered within the variation percentage in accordance with Clause 22.\n\nThe adjustment Calculation for the below formulas shall be conducted on monthly base. The addition/omission amounts resulting from such adjustment calculation will be released or collected every month.\n\nTo the extent that full compensation for rise or fall in Costs is not covered by the provisions/formulas of the Agreement, the adjustment considered by the Agreement formulas, shall be deemed to have included amounts to cover the contingency of other rises and falls in costs, where no further adjustment shall be applied and/or considered.\n\nIn case the Contractor fails to complete the Works within the Contract period/Time for Completion, which failure is not covered by a compensable extension of time granted to the Contractor by the Employer pursuant to the provisions of Contract, adjustment of prices/rates considered by the agreement formulas, if any, shall be made using either (i) each index or price applicable on the last payment certificate issued prior to the expiry of the Contract Period/Time for completion of the Works or (ii) the current index or price, whichever is more favorable to the Employer.\n\nA. USD Currency Exchange Rate:\n\nIn case the rate of exchange for the USD selling rate announced by the Central Bank of Egypt at the date of payment certificate submittal (without any commissions and/or any other charges) became greater/less than EGP 49.00/USD 1.00 (+/-5%) as a Base Rate, the following formula shall be applied on the affected payment certificate/s:\n\nV2 (EGP) = V1 X (1 - Advance Payment Percentage) X 0.20 X [(US Dollars currency exchange new rate/US Dollars fixed exchange rate) -1].\n\nWhere:\n\nV1(EGP) = the gross value for all the certified works done for this particular payment certificate - the gross value of the certified work done for all plain, reinforced concrete and rebar bill items for this particular payment certificate.\n\nV2 (EGP) = the additional/deduction value due to the increase or decrease of the US Dollars fixed exchange rate based on the selling rate announced by the Central Bank of Egypt.\n\nB. Diesel Rate\n\nIn case the price of diesel became greater/less than EGP 15.50 as a Base Rate per liter, the following formula shall be applied only when a new governmental decree is issued officially enforcing this increase.\n\nV2 (EGP) = V1 X (1 - Advance Payment Percentage) X 0.04 X [(Diesel new rate/Diesel fixed rate) -1].\n\nWhere:\n\nV1(EGP) = the gross value for all the certified work done for this particular payment certificate - the gross value of the certified work done for all plain, reinforced concrete and rebar bill items for this particular payment certificate.\n\nV2 (EGP) = the additional/deduction value due to the increase or decrease of the Diesel rates.\n\nC. Cement Rate:\n\nIn case the price of Helwan Cement ex-factory (excluding VAT) became greater/less than EGP 3,500 (+/-5%) as a Base Rate per ton, the following formulas for calculating the additional or deduction value due to the increase or decrease of the factory cement price for the affected payment certificate/s shall be applied only based on the following conditions:\n\nBased on the actual invoices issued by an approved supplier.\n\nThe increase or decrease in the price of cement as produced by Helwan Cement (or similar plants) and as proofed by price quotations shall trigger the utilization of the relevant adjustment formulae.\n\nFor Plain Concrete:\n\nV2 (EGP) = V1 X 0.25 X [Cement new rate - Cement fixed rate].\n\nWhere:\n\nV1 (M3) = The total quantities of the executed plain Concrete affected by the increase or decrease of the factory cement price.\n\nV2 (EGP) = The Additional/Deduction Value due to the increase or decrease of the factory cement price.\n\nFor Reinforced Concrete:\n\nV2 (EGP) = V1 X 0.35 X [Cement new rate - Cement fixed rate].\n\nWhere:\n\nV1 (M3) = The total quantities of the executed reinforced Concrete affected by the increase or decrease of the factory cement price.\n\nV2 (EGP) = The Additional/Deduction Value due to the increase or decrease of the factory cement price.\n\nD. Reinforcement Steel Rebars\n\nIn case the Reinforced Steel Bars factory published price of EZZ steel ex-factory (excluding VAT) for large customers became greater/less than EGP 33,500 (+/-5%) as a Base Rate per ton, the following formula for calculating the additional/deduction value shall be applied within for the affected payment certificate(s) based on the following conditions:\n\nThe Contractor shall submit, for this specific month, the actual invoices, by the approved supplier, approved by the Supervision Consultant through the Materials Inspection Requests.\n\nThe increase or decrease in the price of steel reinforcement as produced by the approved supplier and as proofed by price quotations shall trigger the utilization of the relevant adjustment formulae.\n\nThe Bar Bending Schedules approved by the Supervision Consultant shall be the basis for calculating the actual quantities of Steel bars used (executed) during the month.\n\nV2 (EGP) = V1 X [Steel new rate - steel fixed rate]\n\nWhere:\n\nV1 (ton) = The total quantity of steel executed and certified by the Supervision Consultant.\n\nV2 (EGP) = The Additional/Deduction Value due to the increase or decrease of the factory steel Reinforcement price."
