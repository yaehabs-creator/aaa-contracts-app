TESTS ON COMPLETION\nTime For Tests\n19A.1 The Contractor shall carry out the Tests on Completion in accordance with the Contract to the satisfaction of the Supervision Consultant. The Contractor shall give to the Project Manager, (with a copy to the Supervision Consultant), not less than fourteen (14) days' prior written notice of the date after which the Contractor will be ready to commence the Tests on Completion for any Section or Portion of the Works. Unless otherwise agreed between the Project Manager, Supervision Consultant and the Contractor, the Tests on Completion shall commence within ten (10) days after the said date on such day and at such time as the Supervision Consultant shall notify the Contractor in writing and the Tests on Completion shall thereafter be carried out continuously until completed. If the Supervision Consultant fails so to notify the Contractor or to attend at the time so notified the Contractor may nevertheless commence and carry out the Tests on Completion which shall be deemed to have been made in the Supervision Consultant's presence. After each of the Tests on Completion has itself been completed the Contractor shall forthwith forward to the Project Manager (with a copy to the Supervision Consultant) duly certified copies of the test results.\nDelayed Tests\n19A.2 If in the opinion of the Supervision Consultant the commencement or continuation of the Tests on Completion for any Section or Portion of the Works is being unduly delayed, the Supervision Consultant may, by notice in writing, call upon the Contractor to commence or recommence such Tests within twenty one (21) days from the receipt of the said notice, and the Contractor shall commence or recommence the said Tests on such day and at such time within the said twenty one (21) days as the Contractor may fix and of which it shall give not less than three (3) days' prior written notice to the Project Manager (with a copy to the Supervision Consultant) and the Contractor shall thereafter carry out the said Tests continuously until completed. If the Contractor fails to commence or recommence such Tests within the aforesaid period (without prejudice to the Employer's rights against the Contractor in respect of such failure) the Employer shall (without prejudice to any other remedy) be entitled to employ and pay any other person or persons to commence or recommence the Tests on such day and at such time as the Project Manager may notify to the Contractor in writing and the Employer may thereafter arrange for such other person or persons to carry out such Tests until completed but no such testing by such other person or persons shall in any way relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations or liabilities under the Contract save for carrying out the particular Test or Tests concerned if and to the extent that the results thereof show the same to have been duly passed to the satisfaction of the Supervision Consultant. Neither the Employer nor such other person or persons shall incur any liability whatsoever to the Contractor as a result of or in connection with the carrying out of any such Tests by such other person or persons except insofar as the Contractor may be able to prove that such other person or persons caused deliberate damage or were guilty of gross negligence. The carrying out of any such Tests by such other person or persons shall be deemed to have been carried out in the presence of the Contractor and the result of such Tests shall be accepted as accurate.\nCost of Tests on Completion\n19A.3 The Cost of making all Tests on Completion for any Section or Portion of the Works (including without limitation any repeated Tests on Completion and any such Tests on Completion made by a person or persons employed by the Employer as provided in Clause 19A.2 (Delayed Tests)) shall be borne by the Contractor. The Contractor shall also at its own Cost provide or procure the provision of all documents and other information necessary for such Tests and such suitably qualified and experienced staff, assistance, instruments, apparatus, machines, labour, materials, fuel, utilities, samples, stores and consumables as may be requisite or reasonably demanded by the Supervision Consultant for such Tests. Any Costs which the Employer may incur as a result of the repetition of any such Tests, as a result of the making of any such Tests by such other person or persons, or as the result of the Contractor's failure to commence any such Tests at the time and place notified by the Supervision Consultant shall be determined by the Project Manager and the Employer may deduct the Costs so incurred from any monies due or which may become due to the Contractor or recover the same as a debt due from the Contractor.\nRepeat Tests and Rejection\n19A.4 If the results of any Tests on Completion for any Section or Portion of the Works show the same not to have been duly passed to the satisfaction of the Supervision Consultant, he may, notwithstanding any earlier inspection, examination and/or test or any interim payment:\n(a) order the Contractor in writing to repeat the Test or Tests concerned; and/or\n(b) order the Contractor in writing to take at the Contractor's Cost all such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the relevant Section or Portion of the Works complies with the Contract in all respects and is capable of meeting any performance guarantees which the Contract may contain. The aforesaid steps may, without limitation, include the removal from Site of any Plant which in the Supervision Consultant's opinion is defective or otherwise not in accordance with the Contract and the substitution of proper and suitable Plant.\nIf the Contractor should default in carrying out any such order of the Supervision Consultant as is referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, then (without prejudice to any other rights the Employer may have by virtue of the said default) the Employer shall be entitled to employ and pay any other person or persons to carry out the same at the Contractor's risk and all Costs consequent thereon or incidental thereto shall be determined by the Project Manager and the Employer may deduct the Costs so incurred from any monies due or which may become due to the Contractor or recover the same as a debt due from the Contractor.\nNo Release\n19A.5 The due passing of any Tests on Completion shall not release the Contractor from any of its other obligations under the Contract.",
